<img src="SamAltman.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;">
<p>Sam Altman, Co-Founder and CEO/Former CEO of OpenAI was sacked from the company last Friday (17th of November, 2023) by members of the OpenAI board, however he has been re-instated as boss, as of the 23rd of November, 2023. Mr. Altman posted on X (formerly Twitter) <i>“i love openai, and everything i’ve done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together. when i decided to join msft on sun evening, it was clear that was the best path for me and the team. with the new board and w satya’s support, i’m looking forward to returning to openai, and building on our strong partnership with msft.”</i> The decision to fire Mr. Altman led OpenAI Co-Founder, Greg Brockman to resign from his position at OpenAI. Following Mr. Altman getting fired, Microsoft offered him a job as leader of “a new advanced AI research team”. Co-Founder Greg Brockman said that he would return to OpenAI as well. OpenAI created the wildly popular chatbot “ChatGPT”, and Dall E, the popular image generator.</p>

<h2>Steam Deck OLED is Launced By Valve</h2>

<img src="OLEDDeck.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;">
<p>Steam creator, Valve has released a mid-generation upgrade to their handheld PC, The Steam Deck. This new upgrade comes with a 90Hz OLED display. Valve has also made changes to the storage specs, and the prices, essentially shifting the price for each model down (256GB LCD model used to be $549 or ~ 2,020 AED, but is now $399 or ~1,470 AED), making The Steam Deck a better value than ever – these are not the only changes Valve made, with them changing the bezels on the screen (making them smaller), the battery (increasing battery life), the download speed (increasing the download speed) and improvements to the sound of the fans (making them quieter).</p>

<h2>Researchers use AI to Translate Ancient Languages</h2>
<h3>Written on 25 November 2023</h3>
<img src="Akka.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;">
<p>A group of AI developers explain how they used AI to rapidly translate ancient texts from Cuneiform and Akkadian into English. Many of these documents were never translated, partially due to the few number of experts that can translate these languages. However, these AI developers trained an AI model to translate these texts. Akkadian is considered to be a very important language historically, essentially being the common language used in Mesopotamia and The Middle East in ancient times.</p>

<img src="Patent.png" alt="" style="width: 80%">
<p>Gaming giant, Nintendo has filed a patent for a new device – one with 2 screens that can be separated from one-another and be used as 2 separate devices. This patent has led people to speculate if this device is the successor to the wildly popular <a href="Gadgets.html#Switch"><span class="link">Nintendo Switch.</span></a> This patent appears to look like a more modern version of the Nintendo DS/3DS, but only time will tell if this device ever gets released – until then, we can only speculate.</p>

<h2>51 Qubits Entangled in a Quantum Computer Earlier This Year</h2>
<h3>Written on 25 November 2023</h3>
<img src="QuantumComp.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;">
<p>Researchers at The University of Science and Technology of China managed to entangle 51 Quantum Bits, or “Qubits” in their quantum computer earlier this year. This is the largest number of superconducting qubits ever entangled in a quantum computer. </p>
<p>Quantum Entanglement is a phenomenon where, changing one magnitude of one entangled particle will automatically change the same magnitude on the other entangled particle. For example, changing the state of particle “A” from a 0 to a 1 might automatically update it’s entangled pair, particle “B” from a 0 to a 1. By increasing the number of entangled qubits, the processing speed of the computer increases, therefore improving the performance.</p>
