  <p style="font-size: 24px;">What is The Steam Deck?</p>
  <p>The steam deck is a device created by Valve (the company that created Steam), and released on the 5th of February, 2022. The device is a handheld gaming computer, designed to allow customers to take their gaming library anywhere. The device comes with Valves own operating system pre-installed, called SteamOS. SteamOS runs on Linux, and was developed to bring the optimal gaming experience to this handheld. More recently, Valve released a mid-generation update to the Steam Deck. This device is called the Steam Deck OLED, and has an OLED screen, better battery life, and a quieter fan among other things. But the real question is, should YOU buy it?</p>
  <p style="font-size: 24px;">So, What are the Positives of The Steam Deck?</p>
  <p>The Steam Deck has many different factors that elevate it above other handheld gaming PC products, but one of the most prominent is the price -The base model of the steam deck comes with 256GB of SSD space and an LCD screen. This model comes in at $399USD (~1,470 AED), but the 2 OLED models (512GB and 1TB) come in at $549 (~2,020 AED) and $649 (~2,390 AED). Furthermore, the steam deck is powerful enough to play many modern AAA games such as Resident Evil 4 Remake, Dead Space Remake, Elden Ring and many more!</p>
  <p style="font-size: 24px;">Are There Any Negatives?</p>
  <p>One of the frequently cited cons of The Steam Deck is its battery life -The Steam Deck has a relatively short battery life, where you can get a few hours of battery life on the average game (for example, Stray on -default settings- gets about 3-4 hours of battery life). Another possible negative for The Steam Deck is the refresh rate- on the classic LCD model, the refresh rate goes up to 60 Hz, which some people feel is not enough to play their favourite games, however this is up to personal preference. One of the cons specific to The Steam Deck is that it is not available to buy directly from Valve in the UAE- you must buy it from secondary sources, however one could get around this with the use of a VPN or purchasing it while you are in a country that sells The Steam Deck.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 24px;">Conclusion</p>
  <p>In conclusion, The Steam Deck is a handheld gaming device that allows you to take your Steam library anywhere. It is relatively cheap, the newer models come with an OLED screen, and it can run an impressive number of modern games. However, the battery life isnâ€™t excellent, and it cannot be directly bought in the UAE. Personally, these negatives never affected my experience severely, but it is up to the consumer to decide whether they think that The Steam Deck will be the right fit for them. Overall, I feel that The Steam Deck is a great device for a good price, and that its performance justifies its price, and more!</p>
