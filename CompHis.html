<h2>Colossus 1943</h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/Colossus.png" alt="">
<p>Colossus was a machine built by Tommy Flowers in 1943, that was designed at Bletchley Park (the deciphering epicentre for the Allies in WWII) to break the Lorenz Cipher -used by Adolf Hitler and his generals in WWII- The ciphertext (the encrypted message that was intercepted) was fed into the machine, where it would be decrypted. Colossus is considered to be the first programmable computer, though it was long overshadowed by <a href="#ENIAC"><span class="link"> ENIAC (next entry)<span><a>due to the classified nature of the work Colossus completed.</p>
</div>

<div class="InformationCompHis">
<h2><a id="ENIAC">ENIAC 1945</a></h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/ENIAC.png" alt="">
<p>ENIAC was a computer built in The University of Pennsylvania in 1945. ENIAC was the first publicly known programmable computer at the time. ENIAC covered 167 square metres and weighed 27 Tonnes (as much as almost 4 African Elephants). It could carry out 5000 addition calculations per second, 1000 times faster than anything else that was unclassified at the time.</p>

<div class="InformationCompHis">
<h2>Transistor 1947</h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/Transistor.png" alt="">
<p>In 1947, William Shockley, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen invented the transistor in Bell Laboratories. This innovation removes the need for vacuum tubes to perform calculations, instead using solid electric switches without vacuums. This allowed computers to get smaller, weigh less and be more compact.</p>

<div class="InformationCompHis">
<h2>COBOL 1953</h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/COBOL.png" alt="">
<p>In 1953, Grace Hopper developed the first ever computer language -COBOL. COBOL stands for “COmmon, Business-Oriented Language”. Grace Hopper is commonly dubbed “The First Lady of Software”, a term originating from her posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom citation.</p>

<div class="InformationCompHis">
<h2>Computer Chip 1958</h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/Computer Chip.png" alt="">
<p>In 1958, Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce showcase their “Integrated Circuit” – the first computer chip. The computer chip is the basis for all modern electronics. Kilby won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for his work on the computer chip.</p>

<h2>Prototype of the Modern Computer 1968</h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/SRI_Computer_Mouse.png" alt="">
<p>At the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Fransisco, Douglas Engelbart showcases his prototype of a modern computer in his presentation “A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect”. His presentation had a live demonstration of the computer, with a Graphical-User-Interface (GUI) and a computer mouse. The image above shows Engelbart's computer mouse.</p>

<div class="InformationCompHis">
<h2>The Floppy Disk 1971</h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/FloppyDisk.png" alt="">
<p>Alan Shugard and his colleagues at IBM created the first floppy disk in 1971. The floppy disk is an external storage system that allows data to be shared among users of different computers. This innovation allowed data to be transferred via physical means (such as mail), at low cost due to the light and compact nature of the device.</p>

<div class="InformationCompHis">
<h2>Microsoft 1975</h2>
<img class="Microsoft" src="CompHisImages/Microsoft.png" alt="">
<p>Microsoft was founded on the 4th of April 1975 by childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Microsoft would go on to become the company with the second highest market cap on the stock market, with a value of 2.787 trillion USD (approx. 10.235 trillion AED) as of 16/11/23, behind only <a href="#Apple"><span class="link">Apple.</span></a></p>
</div>

<div class="InformationCompHis">
<h2><a id="Apple">Apple 1976</a></h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/AppleLogo.png" alt="">
<p>Apple was founded on the 1st of April in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. They showcase the Apple I in the same year. Apple would go on to become the largest company in the world by market cap, with a value of USD 2.943 trillion (approx. 10.806 trillion AED) as of 16/11/23.</p>

<div class="InformationCompHis">
<h2>Proposal for the World Wide Web 1989</h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/HTMLProposal.png" alt="">
<p>In 1989, a researcher for CERN, Tim Berners-Lee submitted a proposal that outlined his ideas for a new coding language – HTML – HTML would become the basic building blocks for the World Wide Web, and is the language that this site runs on!</p>
</div>

<div class="InformationCompHis">
<h2>Wi-Fi 1999</h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/WiFi_Logo.png" alt="">
<p>Wireless Fidelity, or “Wi-Fi” as it is commonly known was developed in 1999. Wi-Fi originally could cover a distance of 91 metres! Wi-Fi would go on to be a major industry with many different service providers. Wi-Fi would become the main method of transmitting data over the internet.</p>

<div class="InformationCompHis">
<h2>First Reprogrammable Quantum Computer 2016</h2>
<img src="CompHisImages/Quantum Computer.png" alt="">
<p>In 2016, Shantanu Debnath and his team created the first programmable quantum computer at the University of Maryland. Before this, quantum computers had to be pre-programmed, and the algorithms couldn’t be changed. This innovation showcases the development of a quantum future, where quantum computers could replace conventional computers.</p>
