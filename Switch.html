  <p style="font-size: 24px;">What is The Nintendo Switch?</p>
  <p>The Nintendo Switch is a device created by Nintendo and released on the 3rd of March, 2017. The Nintendo Switch is a “hybrid console”- meaning that it can be used as a handheld, and a home console. The Switch comes with the device, a pair of “Joy-Cons” (the controllers) a “Joy-Con Grip” and a docking station. The device runs on a custom operating system. There are 3 models, the standard model, the OLED model, and the “Lite” model. The standard model comes in at $299 (~1,100 AED), the OLED at $349 (~1,300 AED) and the Lite at $199 (730 AED). So, now I ask, should YOU buy it?</p>
  <p style="font-size: 24px;">So, What are the Positives of The Nintendo Switch?</p>
  <p>The Nintendo Switch boasts a large game library - More than 5,000 games according to the official Nintendo Website – which includes the likes of “Mario Kart 8 Deluxe” (My personal favourite), “Super Smash Bros Ultimate”, “Super Mario Odyssey”, “Super Mario Bros. Wonder”,” The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild”, “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom”, “Splatoon 2 & 3” and many more. The Switch also has a feature called “Nintendo Switch Online” a subscription-based service that brings extra content to The Switch – this content comes in the form of DLC (Downloadable Content) such as the “Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass”, access to NES, SNES, GameBoy, GameBoy Advance, Nintendo 64 and The Sega Mega Drive titles that have been picked by Nintendo. Moreover, Nintendo Switch Online allows you to play games like “Super Smash Bros Ultimate” online with your friends!</p>
  <p style="font-size: 24px;">Are There Any Negatives?</p>
  <p>However, The Nintendo Switch does have some negatives, the most prominent being the graphics, the processing power and the Joy-Cons. The graphics on the switch were considered to be behind current-generation consoles, even on release in 2017, however I have never felt that the graphics ruined the experience. The processing power suffers from the same problem as the graphics, where they were outdated on release. This is especially prominent when playing more demanding games/parts of games. For example, in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, when playing with 3 or more players on screen, the game can begin to lag which is mildly annoying. Where the processing power is really shown to be a problem is when playing newer games – For example, Nickelodeon All Star Brawl will take upwards of 30 seconds to load into a game (on my hardware at least). The final common critique of The Switch are the Joy-Cons – They are quite uncomfortable to hold for extended periods of time, they may not fit into large hands comfortably, and after time they get drift (drift is when the joystick will measure movement on its own without the user touching the stick. This will usually happen in 1 direction). Drift is the largest problem, and when the Joy-Cons get drift, they are virtually useless. You can get around this buy buying the “Pro Controllers” which are significantly more comfortable for users with large hands, and don’t get drift nearly as frequently as the Joy-Cons. One could also buy third-party controllers as an alternative to the Pro Controllers.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 24px;">Conclusion</p>
  <p>In conclusion, The Nintendo Switch is a fun device to play games on – The games are fun, the movement and controls feel nice and the hybrid-portability is excellent for those who travel a lot. There are a few negatives with The Switch, but nothing that would ruin the experience (at least for me). The main issue are the Joy-Cons, but they can easily be replaced. Overall, I believe that The Switch is a fun device from Nintendo that has a great price: fun ratio, and provides hours of fun!</p>
